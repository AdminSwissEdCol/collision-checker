I need to check a huge google sheet tab "raw"for students which already took  a course or not. I want to be able to put in course codes (column E "Course Code") and student emails (column B "Email") which the new semester woudl include and check the raw sheet if there are collisions (students already took course). csv of raw attached. I want a this to be repeatable if i change the courses and student names for the upcoming semester.

Architected reusable collision-detection tool for course enrollment verification.




I can see the structure. I'll create a reusable collision checker tool for you.


1 step

Copy to outputs



Presented file
Here's a reusable collision checker tool.

How to use it:

Upload your raw CSV - the historical grade data you provided
Paste course codes - one per line (e.g., AE2010, FI3020)
Paste student emails - one per line from your new semester enrollment
Click "Check for Collisions" - it will show any students who already took those courses
The tool shows the student name, email, course code, and which session they previously took it. You can change the inputs and re-check as many times as needed for different semesters.

maybe a apps script is more userfriendly.

11:28 AM
Good point — an Apps Script that works directly in Google Sheets will be much more practical. Let me create that instead.


Create a Google Apps Script for course collision checking directly in Sheets
CourseCollisionChecker.gs

Presented file
Here's the Apps Script version. Setup:

Open your Google Sheet (the one with the "raw" tab)
Go to Extensions → Apps Script
Delete any existing code and paste this script
Click Save, then close the Apps Script editor
Refresh your spreadsheet — a new "Collision Checker" menu appears
Click Collision Checker → Setup Checker Sheet
To use:

Paste course codes in column A (starting row 3)
Paste student emails in column B (starting row 3)
Click Collision Checker → Check for Collisions
Results show in columns D-G with student name, email, course, and session they took it
You can change the inputs and re-run anytime for different semesters.

Architected multi-sheet collision detection system matching students to courses by level.
10s







I see the structure. The "Class" column contains the student's level (e.g., 26-T1-Class-Certificate, 26-T2-Class-Diploma). Let me create an enhanced version that:

Imports returning students with their levels
Has a course-to-level mapping
Automatically matches students to their level's courses and checks for collisions

Create enhanced Apps Script with level-based collision checking
CourseCollisionChecker_v2.gs

Presented file
Here's the upgraded version with level support.

Setup:

Replace the old script with this one in Extensions → Apps Script
Refresh, then click Collision Checker → Setup All Sheets
This creates 3 sheets:

Sheet	Purpose
Students	List of returning students (Email + Level + Name)
Courses	Course codes mapped to levels (Certificate, Diploma, etc.)
Results	Collision output
Workflow:

Rename your return file tab to "Return"
Click Collision Checker → Import Students from Return Sheet — this auto-extracts emails and levels from the Class column (e.g., 26-T2-Class-Diploma → Diploma)
In the Courses sheet, add/edit the courses for each level (I pre-populated it with the courses you listed)
Click Check for Collisions
The script matches students to courses by their level, then checks if they already took those courses in the "raw" data. Results show student name, email, level, course, and which session they previously took it.

Validated user's workflow comprehension across three sequential steps.


Yes, exactly right! Here's the workflow:

Step 1: "Return" sheet Paste your upcoming semester students with the Class column (the script extracts the level from 26-T1-Class-Certificate → Certificate)

Step 2: Import Click Collision Checker → Import Students from Return Sheet This populates the "Students" sheet with emails + levels automatically

Step 3: "Courses" sheet Set up which courses go to which level:

Course Code	Course Name	Level
1022A	Beverages	Certificate
1021A	F&B Service Operations	Certificate
2040A	Accounting	Diploma
...	...	...
Step 4: Check Click Collision Checker → Check for Collisions

The script then checks: "For each student at level X, have they already taken any of the courses assigned to level X in the raw historical data?"

Results show any students who already completed courses they're scheduled to take again.

Presented 2 files

Recognized user's request to parse exported schedule files into course codes and levels.


Done! I extracted 67 courses from your timetable PDF and updated the script to support all levels.

Levels extracted:

Certificate (11 courses)
Diploma (8 courses)
High Diploma (10 courses)
BBA (10 courses)
PGD (11 courses)
MBA (10 courses)
CUL I (3 courses)
CUL II (3 courses)
English (1 course)

thats nice, but how would I do this without you? a simple program on my truenas machine in a docker container? but much better would be something independant, usable by other users? can app script extraxt from pdf?

1:56 PM

Weighed automation options: Docker, web app, or Apps Script for PDF parsing.






Great questions! Let me address both:

Apps Script + PDF: Limited. It can access PDFs in Drive but can't reliably parse timetable layouts — the text comes out jumbled (like that .txt file you uploaded).

Better solutions:

Self-contained web app (best for sharing) — runs entirely in browser, no server needed
Docker container — good for your TrueNAS, but overkill for this
Let me build you a standalone HTML tool that anyone can use — just open the file or host it anywhere:


2 steps

Presented file

Orchestrated deployment strategies for independent, multi-user accessibility.

Here's a standalone HTML tool that runs entirely in the browser — no server needed!

What it does:

Parses timetable PDFs using pdf.js (client-side)
Detects page titles (Certificate, Diploma, MBA, etc.) to determine levels
Extracts course codes (like 1022A, 2040B)
Outputs CSV ready to paste into Google Sheets
How to use it:

Option	Effort	Who can access
Just open the HTML file	None	You only
Host on TrueNAS	Low	Your network
GitHub Pages	Low	Anyone with link
Any web host	Low	Anyone
Deployment options:

Local use: Just download and double-click the HTML file
TrueNAS: Put it in a shared folder or run a simple nginx container:
bash
   docker run -d -p 8080:80 -v /path/to/html:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro nginx:alpine
GitHub Pages (free, public):
Create a repo, upload the HTML as index.html
Enable Pages in repo settings
Share the URL with anyone
Limitations:

PDF text extraction isn't perfect — course names may not always be detected (codes are reliable though)
You may need to manually fill in some course names
Want me to also create a version with a simple backend (Python/Docker) for more robust PDF parsing?

good almost, the html is converted to a google doc automatically if clicked on. how can a make the shared link an autodownload from the folde without the conversion?

2:14 PM

Identified multiple workarounds to bypass Google Drive's HTML conversion.



Ah yes, Google Drive tries to "help" by converting HTML files. Two easy solutions:

Option 1: Change the share link format

Instead of the normal share link:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/FILE_ID/view
Use this format (forces download):

https://drive.google.com/uc?id=FILE_ID&export=download
Option 2: Zip it (simplest - Google won't convert zip files)


2 steps

Presented file

Prepared to clarify file sharing and download options.

Here's the zipped version — upload this to Google Drive and share it. Users download the zip, extract, and open the HTML.

Summary of options:

Method	How
Zip file ✅	Share the .zip — Google won't convert it
Direct download link	Change /file/d/ID/view → /uc?id=ID&export=download
GitHub Pages	Free hosting, no conversion issues, runs directly in browser
GitHub Pages is actually the best for this use case — users just visit the URL and use the tool directly, no download needed. Want me to walk you through setting that up? It's about 5 minutes.

ok, so i just add this as a new repo? and make thsi the only open repo?

2:16 PM

Charted GitHub Pages setup strategy and repository configuration.



Yes exactly! Here's how:

1. Create new repo

Click the green "New" button (top right)
Name it something like timetable-tools or course-extractor
Set to Public (required for free GitHub Pages)
Check "Add a README file"
Click Create repository
2. Upload the HTML

In the new repo, click Add file → Upload files
Upload the HTML file but rename it to index.html first (important!)
Commit
3. Enable GitHub Pages

Go to repo Settings → Pages (left sidebar)
Under "Source" select Deploy from a branch
Branch: main, folder: / (root)
Click Save
4. Wait ~1 minute, then your tool is live at:

https://adminswissedcol.github.io/timetable-tools/
Share that link with anyone — they can use the tool directly in their browser, no download needed.

Quick rename command if needed:

bash
mv timetable_course_extractor.html index.html
Want me to also create a nice README.md for the repo explaining how to use the tool?

yes. best if the repo and readme has the link to the google sheet with the app script as well and the class list. also the import studens from return sheet should be added to the check for collisions, so it happens automatically.
